**Welcome to the PyQKD package for Quantum Key Distribution protocols simulation and optimisation with Parallel Genetic Algorithms.**

This repository was created as a side result of various research projects conducted at the International Centre for Theory of Quantum Technologies. The problem which led to writing a universal framework of a parallel genetic algorithm was a multi-variable optimisation problem of the QKD in quantum cryptography. Thus, some files for simulating BB84 protocol can be found in here, including an computationally optimised approach to the post-processing of data, especially the error correction stage. However, the main scope of this project now and in the coming weeks is creating a `pyqkd.genal` package which will provide Users with a framework for applying a Parallel Genetic Algorithm to any problem they may have.

I'm happy to collaborate with more people, so please feel free to join!
Cheers,
Jakub
